# Neural Modeling Environment

This repository contains materials, examples, and system-specific guides for developing and running neural models (NEURON, BMTK, CoreNEURON, MPI workflows, etc.).

All installation and environment setup instructions have been consolidated in the single authoritative document:

- [python_environment_setup.md](./python_environment_setup.md)

### What remains in this document

- High-level conceptual guidance, workflows, and model-specific examples (non-installation content).

### Recommended workflow

1. Prepare your environment using `python_environment_setup.md`.
2. Run quick, small tests locally to validate imports and basic behavior.
3. Use the HPC-specific guides (e.g., `hellbender_hpc_guide.md`) for cluster access and scheduling.

If you need installation commands, dependency pinning, or verification instructions, consult `python_environment_setup.md`.
