# Modeling Environment Setup — Table of Contents

This repository contains guidance for creating a Python environment for neural modeling and working on HPC systems. Below is a quick index of the major documents and what you'll find in them.

- [python_environment_setup.md](./python_environment_setup.md) — Consolidated, authoritative install and environment creation guide (Miniconda, conda env, pip/conda packages, NEURON, BMTK, mpi4py, CoreNEURON notes, verification and troubleshooting).

- [neural_modeling_env.md](./neural_modeling_env.md) — Overview of the neural modeling environment, recommended workflow, and links to the consolidated install guide.

- [hellbender_hpc_guide.md](./hellbender_hpc_guide.md) — Hellbender HPC system-specific quick start, job submission and SSH/OnDemand workflow; points to `python_environment_setup.md` for installs.

- [README.md] — intentionally replaced by `python_environment_setup.md` to keep a single installation reference. See `python_environment_setup.md` first.
