# Modeling Environment Setup

All environment and installation steps have moved to the consolidated guide:

- [python_environment_setup.md](./python_environment_setup.md)

Please follow that file for Miniconda installation, conda environment creation, package installation, MPI/NEURON/BMTK setup, verification, and troubleshooting.
