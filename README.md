# Modeling Environment Setup

All environment and installation steps have moved to the consolidated guide:

- [python_environment_setup.md](./python_environment_setup.md)

Please follow that file for Miniconda installation, conda environment creation, package installation, MPI/NEURON/BMTK setup, verification, and troubleshooting.

## Quick repository index

This repository contains the main guides and quick references for setting up modeling environments and working on HPC.
